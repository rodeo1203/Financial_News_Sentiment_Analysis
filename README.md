# Financial News Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In the financial domain, sentiment analysis on news articles can be crucial for understanding market trends, investor sentiment, and potential impacts on stock prices. This project focuses on building and evaluating a sentiment analysis model for financial news using both a custom-built LSTM model and a pre-trained language model.
